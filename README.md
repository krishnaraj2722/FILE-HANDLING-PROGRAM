DESCRIPTION:-This repository contains my solution for Internship Task 1: File Handling in C as part of the CodTech internship program. The task includes creating a menu-driven program in C that performs basic file operations such as creating a file, writing data to it, reading the file content, and appending new data. The program is fully functional and written in pure C language using standard file handling functions like fopen, fputs, fgetc, and fclose. This task helped me understand how data can be stored and manipulated through files in a console-based application.
